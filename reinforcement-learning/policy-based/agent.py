        Notes
        -----
        In order for the agent to best learn the optimal actions, it is common to evaluate the
        expected future rewards. Then, the agent can adjust its predicted action probabilities
        (policy) so that this expected reward is maximized. This is done through the REINFORCE
        algorithm, which computes the policy gradient. Algorithm modified from:
