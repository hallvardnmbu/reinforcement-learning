Learning goals:

- Understand and know how to build, use and deploy reinforcement learning algorithms
  * Experiment with reinforcement agent(s) (for instance playing video-games)

Learning outcomes:

- Be competent in modern deep learning situations
  * Understand (and to some extent be able to reproduce) cutting-edge “artificial intelligence”
    models
